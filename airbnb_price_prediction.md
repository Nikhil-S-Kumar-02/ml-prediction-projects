# Airbnb Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices based on various property features. The objective is to help hosts understand which factors influence pricing and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize revenue.

##  Problem Statement
Build a regression model to estimate the price of Airbnb listings based on features like location, property type, room type, number of reviews, and host characteristics.

##  Methods Used
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- One-Hot Encoding  
- Correlation Analysis  
- Model Building: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor  
- Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Model Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R²

##  Libraries & Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

##  Results & Insights
- Model performed well with acceptable error metrics  
- Key Influencing Features: Room type, Location, Number of reviews  
- Recommendation: Optimize pricing strategies based on feature importance

##  Files Included
- `airbnb_price_prediction.md`: Jupyter notebook with complete workflow  
- `README.md`: Project documentation
