# Airbnb Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting Airbnb listing prices based on various property features. The goal is to help hosts better understand which factors influence pricing and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize their listings.

##  Problem Statement
Build a regression model to estimate the price of Airbnb listings based on attributes like location, property type, room type, number of reviews, and host characteristics.

##  Methods Used
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- One-Hot Encoding
- Correlation Analysis
- Model Building: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

##  Libraries & Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

##  Results & Insights
- Model performed well with acceptable error metrics
- Important features: Room type, Location, Number of reviews
- Recommendations: Optimize pricing strategy based on feature importance

##  Files Included
- `ML_Proj_P1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full workflow
- `README.md`: This documentation
